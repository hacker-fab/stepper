# lithography-stepper
CAD files for photolithography stepper. Note that the stepper motor code is not being used, as we are looking into using a [Delta Stage](https://github.com/hacker-fab/delta-stage-controller) or [Piezoelectric Nanopositioner](https://github.com/hacker-fab/piezoelectric-nanopositioner) instead.
